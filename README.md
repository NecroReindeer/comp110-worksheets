# COMP110 Weekly Reflective Report

##Week 2
I initially struggled with SpaceChem, finding it difficult to develop working solutions.   
After being stuck on one particular level for a while, I realised that the reason I was failing to make progress was the fact that I was reluctant to take different approaches due to being unable to easily revert back to a previous solution. I decided to take a screenshot, making me feel more comfortable about starting the solution from scratch and resulting in me solving it almost immediately afterwards. This highlights one of the advantages of using version control when programming.  
After this breakthrough, I applied a similar approach to subsequent problems and found them significantly easier. I also went back and improved some of my solutions to earlier levels.  
I intend to continue playing SpaceChem both to fulfill the last of the extra criteria on Worksheet 1 and to improve my problem solving skills.
